title: Food, Family, and a Little Shopping
f_issue-summary: >-
  The end of November gives us the opportunity to come together as family, share
  experiences, and after it's all over, engage in a little bit of shameless
  consumerism. In this issue, we explore thanksgiving, family ties, and share
  some of our favorite shopping lists as you begin to think about the season of
  giving.
